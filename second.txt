Hi everyone,
Welcome to this article. In today's digital age, understanding HTML is very essential for anyone who are interested in web development, design, content creation.
Do you know what is HTML?
  HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to create web pages in internet. The content of webpages is created by using HTML tags.
So, first let's see what are HTML tags.
HTML documents are structured using HTML tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets
The basic structure of HTML document is
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
 </body
</html>
where <!DOCTYPE html> tells that the type of the document is html
HTML offers various tags for formatting, here are some of the basic tags
<h1> to <h6>         - used for headings
                     - <h1> size is bigger than <h6>
<p> </p>             - used for writing paragraphs
<marquee> </marquee> - used for scrolling of text
<ol> </ol>           - used for ordered list
<ul> </ul>           - used for unordered list
<b> </b>             - used to bold the text
HTML also allows us to redirect from one webpage to other using hyperlinks(<a> tags).Image tags are used to display images on webpage.
For these we need attributes like href for hyperlinks and src for images.
<a href =" ">
<img src=" ">
